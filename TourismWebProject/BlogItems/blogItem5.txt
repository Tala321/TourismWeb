<p><strong>Where are the best neighborhoods and hotels to stay in Bangkok?</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got you covered! Bangkok is one of my favorite cities in the world and I have spent a ton of time there.</p>

<p>What I love most about Bangkok is that it&rsquo;s endlessly interesting. Beyond that, Bangkok has some of the most delicious street food on the planet. And my personal favorite: you can get massages everywhere for super cheap &mdash; only about $7 per hour! And compared to other major cities, Bangkok is super cheap.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re traveling through Southeast Asia, chances are you&rsquo;ll route through Bangkok several times. And if you&rsquo;re visiting other destinations in Thailand, you&rsquo;ll likely spend the beginning and end of your trip in Bangkok. So you should try to stay in the neighborhood that is best for you &mdash; or even multiple neighborhoods if you&rsquo;ve got enough time!</p>

<h3><strong>Best Neighborhoods to Stay in Bangkok</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Bangkok is a megacity, and it is chock full of diverse neighborhoods.</strong>&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t paint the city with a single brushstroke. Some frenetic neighborhoods are more suited for partiers; others are more suited for people who want to get away from Bangkok&rsquo;s craziness.</p>

<p>Your biggest consideration should be how you plan to spend your time in Bangkok. If you plan on zipping all over the city, you&rsquo;ll probably be better off close to a transit station. If you&rsquo;re coming here for an overnight after a trip to the islands, you might want to stay in a shopping district so you can buy tons of souvenirs without having to drag them all over the country. And maybe you want to be as close as possible to Bangkok&rsquo;s insane nightlife. Whatever you&rsquo;re into, Bangkok has the perfect neighborhood for you!</p>
